### About
This project provides a simple server-side script to generate a website of movie trailers from a CSV file. I have written a server-side code to store a list of my favourite movies. I then added to Allan Reyes' code to generate a static web page for you to browse my favourite movies and watch their trailers.
### How to Run
I built this program with Python 2.7.11. If you havenâ€™t got this, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have extracted the Movie Trailer Website files to the same folder you will be able to view the website by opening and running entertainment_centre.py with Python.
